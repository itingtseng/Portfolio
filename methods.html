As of September 2018, LinkedIn claims to be "the world’s largest professional network, with more than 562 million users." (LinkedIn, 2018) LinkedIn’s stated vision is "Create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce." The website allows its members to present a public professional profile and connect with others who have done the same. It provides related services that help members to communicate with each other and to connect with employers. Basic membership is free, but additional services can be purchased.</p>

                        <p>Our team chose LinkedIn for the task analysis. We set two scenarios for our users. and the second is: searching and applying jobs on LinkedIn. During our contextual inquiry, we would ask user to update LinkedIn profile. At the same time, we would introduce ourselves, explain project and gather demographics like age, gender, professional/student, job title etc. during the observation. We conducted semi-structured interview and we introduce ourselves, explain project and gather demographics, either. The questions we ask users including why do they use it, when do they use it, where do they use it, what do you like or dislike about it, and what would you change about it. We use pen and paper for recording and we use optional audio backup.<br>
                            <!--<br>It turn out that LinkedIn users including students and professionals in various corporations and industries. Most users are among the typical employment age range (18-67), and most of our users are using LinkedIn when they are at a transition point between careers. The skills to perform tasks within LinkedIn varies depending on how long and what frequency they use LinkedIn.<br>
                            <br>In addition, there is no typical environment that users use LinkedIn, and the device users like to use LinkedIn is not specific to mobil phone or laptop, neither.<br>
                            <br>My teammate and I discussed the observation protocol and interview protocol together. After we gathering our data, we use affinity diagraming for qualitative research analysis. We put ideas on sticky notes and grouped them.<br>
                            <br>Many users mentioned about the problem when they tried to login LinkedIn, and they also mentioned about the premium account issue.<br>-->
                            <br>After we creating affinity diagraming, we discussed two representative persona for LinkedIn users.

                        <p>I know the process of analysis qualitative data during the exercise. By compiling data (our sticky notes), we understood that it was not easy to share data with team. Because everyone has different opinion for what should put down in the sticky notes. Some teammate thought that we should write down the demographic for our users, and some teammate thought that we should write user’s action that they have behaved during the observation or interviewing. After all our teammates have placed all that data on the white board, there was another problem. We all have various comments for how to group these sticky notes. One of my teammate said that we should based on the questions that we asked them, and the other teammate stressed that it should be according to the process we conducted in the contextual inquiry or interview. We have spent lots of time communicating about it. However, we all have a consensus and then we can draw the connections across the data and look for patterns. We identified overall trends by interpreting finding in our affinity diagramming.

                            <p>LinkedIn users are students and professionals, as well as hiring personnel at various corporations and industries. Most users are assumed to be within the typical employment age range (18-67). They are likely to be at the start of their career or at a transition point between careers. Their computer skills can be between beginner and experienced users, but the skills needed to perform tasks within LinkedIn varies depending on the amount of time spent engaged with the site.</p>
                            <h5 style="margin-top: 50px">Task Analysis</h5>

                            <h5 style="margin-top: 50px">Personas</h5>
                            <p>Sam is a 42 year old Software engineer LinkedIn user. He uses the site every evening after work and loves the interaction he has with other users of the site. Sam was downsized recently, and finds himself looking for new employment. Although Sam uses LinkedIn on a regular basis, he has not updated his profile since he started the account five years ago. While attempting to update his profile and resume information, Sam encountered problems updating his information. Remembering his password was an immediate problem since he used his former employer’s computer to set up his initial account. Luckily he used his personal email account instead of his former work account, and he was able to reset his password. Once this was resolved, locating the appropriate menu items and navigation to change and update his information wasn’t as intuitive of a process as he had hoped. Sam also noticed that some of the features he might want to use would come at a cost. The premium service offers individuals the ability to know which companies and individuals viewed his profile. He felt this could be of help in targeting his resume and cover letters more effectively. But he found the price hard to justify, given the limited features offered.<br>
                                <br>Sam knows he will have to make these changes, and wishes there was a better way to accomplish the task. Sam is old enough to remember the days of sending out resumes and cover letters, one-by-one. Using LinkedIn would make the process easier to get in front of more possible employers, He just wished doing so was easier to accomplish. LinkedIn claims that “I’m the boss of my account”, but it seems to Sam they choose the path of his interaction, rather than let him be in control of how he interacts with his data and their site.

                            <h5>Recommendations and Feedback</h5>
                            <!--<p>Team 7 used heuristic evaluation methods for usability testing on the LinkedIn website for our team. They also used the cognitive walkthrough method with the persona Sam. Their findings are below.<br>
                                <br>By identifying problems, they then conclude these problems and provide relevant suggestions for heuristic evaluation. It is an easy way to evaluate the process the whole picture of the website, however, they also felt this way has some drawbacks:
                            </p>-->
                            <p>I. Require a certain level of knowledge and experience to apply</p>
                            <!--<p>Linkedin and Canvas are both websites which we are really familiar with. Therefore, we spent less time getting familiar with it. However, aside from websites that we use on a daily basis, it takes time to realize the main problem for the system. Therefore, the familiarity could be an issue for conducting a heuristic evaluation.</p>-->
                            <p>II. Does not allow to assess the quality of redesign</p>
                            <!--<p>Though rating the severity of these problems, there are few practical redesign ideas we could provide by using heuristic analysis. It takes extra effort to present our redesign ideas at this time.</p>-->
                            <h5>Prioritized Issues</h5>
                            <p>I. More flexible editing environment for updating profile</p>
                            <!--<p>To make the editing environment more friendly for our users, the system should allow users to reorder their records, and to preview their profiles by easily switching between editor and viewer modes.</p>-->
                            <p>II. Personalize job searching experience</p>
                            <!--<p>To optimize the job searching experience, which is the major experience for users, the system needs to provide an intuitive button for the job-saving list, and the suggested keywords to allow users do more relevant searching by providing additional keywords.</p>-->
                            <p>III. Revise inconsistency on profile editing</p>
                            <!--<p>The current website has lots of inconsistency, including update background picture, minimize drop-down box and so on. We suggest to list down the all the inconsistency and compile them by navigating different user flows and scenarios.</p>-->
                            <h5>Suggestions For Task Analysis and Personas</h5>
                            <p>I. Avoid identifying the skilled users as the persona in IT, CS, ME field. Try to identify problems for the unskilled group of people.<br>
                                <br>II. Select new-beginners as typical users for primary persona could be more valuable.<br>
                                <br>III. The scenarios within task analysis do consider the difficulties for users.<br>
                                <!--<h5>Our Response to Suggestions</h5>
                                <p>It would be reasonable to create a persona that is a new LinkedIn user, and for a full in-depth study we would definitely include such a persona. However, we believe that Patricia serves a similar purpose while also being more representative of the LinkedIn user population. Regarding suggestion #1, Patricia is not technically savvy. And regarding suggestion #2, Patricia has minimal familiarity with the site because she rarely uses it. This trait provides a framework to investigate issues of both learnability and memorability.

                        <p>For this part of our study of LinkedIn, we conducted a think-aloud protocol to evaluate usability. Participants were asked to complete the following tasks:<br>
                            <br>Task #1: Perform the steps necessary to update the photo in their LinkedIn profile, using a provided image. (We asked the participants to stop one step short of updating the image, because we didn’t want the test to result in an actual change to their profile.)<br>
                            <br>Task #2: Find a job listing for an Administrative Support Specialist at IUPUI, and report the required qualifications for that job.<br>
                            <br>Our criteria for failing either task were as follows:<br>
                            <br>I. The user takes more than 5 minutes (300 seconds) to complete the task.<br>
                            <br>II. The user announces they have completed the task but they have not done so.<br>

Provide the participants with a printed task sheet so that they could easily see the task description instead of having to remember it or read it from our protocol script. This was especially relevant for finding the “Administrative Support Specialist” job.<br>
                                <br>III. Instruct the participants to announce that they have completed each task when they felt they had done so, in order to have a specific cue to end the timing of the task.<br>
                                <br>IV. Specify more clearly the starting state of the system for each task. For example, task #2 should have started from the website’s home page, instead of on the profile editing page at the end of task #1, with the photo change still in progress.<br>
                                <!--<br>The selected tasks were not difficult, and LinkedIn is a popular website with generally good usability, so the success rate is not surprising. Although participants were mostly able to complete the tasks required, the site seems less intuitive for new or infrequent users: participants’ times decrease with the frequency of time spent on the site. Based on this observation, we would recommend to LinkedIn that they focus on improving their site’s learnability and memorability.<br>
                                <br>I have learned the process of think loud observation. We broke complex tasks into small parts and inspected our task analysis to clearly structured tasks that help the user focus on evolution. We worked on the protocol together to make sure that a few phrase we might use. And the most important is keeping the user talking. Because it is an observation, the other part of protocol is like what we have done in the previous the observation before. Our criteria for critical incidents is that user can’t attain goal within 5 minutes. Hence, one of our participant took too long and that means task failure.<br>
                                <br>After our teammates all finished think loud, we put outcome statistics in the table above. We use “task success” for our usability performance metrics. And I use what we have learned from the class to calculate predefined goal.-->

                        <h5>Self-Reported Metrics</h5>
                        <p>After each participant completed the tasks, we asked them to fill out a System Usability Scale (SUS). From these scores we calculated the following values:<br>
                            <br>Mean: 71.9<br>
                            <br>Confidence Interval: 61.5 to 82.4<br>
                            <br>Using an SUS value of 70.0 as a benchmark for acceptability, we are 60% confident that the population would give LinkedIn an acceptable or better SUS score.<br>

                        <h5 style="margin-top: 50px">Next Steps</h5>
                        <p>Updates to the site could increase the usability and the confidence interval level given the sample size. We feel this could be done by revising the inconsistency associated with profile editing and better automating and personalizing the job searching experience.</p>
